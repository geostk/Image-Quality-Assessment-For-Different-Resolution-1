# Image-Quality-Assessment-For-Different-Resolution
# Introduction
Nowadays people use different devices to acquire visual information, so an algorithm to assess quality of images with different resolution is in need. In this article, we propose a full reference image quality assessment algorithm for different resolution and test its performance. Moreover, we have tested and analyzed the difference of choosing different regression training methods to the same parameters extracted. Hope to provide a reference for the choice of training method in future development of image quality assessment.
